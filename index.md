**Search and discovery of local government meetings for
journalists** 

*Doug Beeferman and Nabeel Gillani*

search engine, local news, local government, natural language processing

Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, city council and
school board meetings are recorded and made available
online much more frequently than before.  The transcripts
of these meetings provide a valuable data source for
journalists, policymakers, and social science researchers
in an environment in which local news media is otherwise
eroding.

In this talk we will discuss CivicSearch
(https://civicsearch.org), a search engine, discovery tool,
and alerting platform that builds upon a research corpus of
these transcripts called LocalView (https://localview.net).
CivicSearch is designed to analyze government meetings that
are posted online soon after they occur.  Using recent
advances in natural language processing, it automatically
clusters the conversations within these meetings into
subject areas, and for each subject area identifies a set
of issues and problem areas that local policymakers are
trying to solve.  Users may search for or monitor
individual keywords or entire subject areas, using large
language model-based summarization to synthesize findings
across jurisdictions.  The system also identifies specific
geographic points of interest in communities that are
mentioned in the meetings, enabling users to keep track of
how places near to them are being discussed by policymakers.

CivicSearch currently includes the transcripts of about 650
cities and towns in the US and Canada.  Journalists are
using it to research stories and to monitor mentions of
terms related to their beats.  In our talk, we'll discuss a
few real-world use cases of the tool, including studies on
chronic absenteeism in schools, drug treatment policy, and
racial extremism.

**A Case Study in an A.I.-Assisted Content Audit** <a href="papers/CJ_2024_paper_36.pdf">📂</a>

*Rahul Bhargava, Elisabeth Hadjis and Meg Heckman*

journalism, content audit, artificial intelligence

This paper presents an experimental case study utilizing
machine learning and generative AI to audit content
diversity in a hyperlocal news outlet, TS, based at a
university and focused on underrepresented communities in
Boston. Through computational text analysis, including
entity extraction, topic labeling, and quote extraction and
attribution, we evaluate the extent to which TS's coverage
aligns with its mission to amplify diverse voices. The
results reveal coverage patterns, topical focus, and source
demographics, highlighting areas for improvement in
editorial practices. This research underscores the
potential for AI-driven tools to support similar small
newsrooms in enhancing content diversity and alignment with
their community-focused missions. Future work envisions
developing a cost-effective auditing toolkit to aid
hyperlocal publishers in assessing and improving their
coverage.

**Participatory Journalism: Stakeholder Perspectives on
Enhancing Online Discussion through Data Talk** <a href="papers/CJ_2024_paper_35.pdf">📂</a>

*Cole Biehle, Ritvik Irigireddy, Lu Sun and Steven P. Dow*

data talk, data visualization, journalism, online discussion, news website

Discussing data related to news is one form of
participatory journalism. \textit{Data talk} can promote
data literacy, foster community around grounded
understanding, and encourage civic engagement. What are the
challenges and potential of scaffolding data talk on news
websites? To understand current practices and perceptions
around future visions for audience engagement in news, we
interviewed 12 diverse stakeholders including journalists,
data scientists, readers, and moderators. To provoke future
thinking, we asked participants to react to our interactive
design probe with three scenarios: questioning data on a
chart, adding data views, and telling personal data
stories. We identified several challenges stakeholders face
with data talk, including the fast news cycle hindering
thorough data discussions and the difficulty of creating
accessible insights and visuals. Despite significant data
wrangling, discussions around the data remain rare.
Participants reacted positively to the interactive
scaffolding features in the three design scenarios, noting
that these features can make data an effective entry point
for discussions, scaffold audience participation in the
data pipeline, and lower the barrier to engagement.

**Talk: The Speed and Sentiment of News in Twitter (X) vs.
Radio** 

*William Brannon and Deb Roy*

News cycle, Twitter (X), Talk radio, Event detection, Outrage, Agenda-setting, Comparative media analysis

The rapid evolution of the Internet is reshaping the media
landscape, with frequent claims of an accelerated and
increasingly outraged news cycle. We test these claims
empirically, investigating the dynamics of news spread,
decay, and sentiment on Twitter (X) versus talk radio. Both
platforms are significant -- radio for its wide reach and
political influence, and Twitter for its large user base
and high concentration of journalists.

Analyzing 2019-2021 data including 517,000 hours of radio
content and 26.6 million tweets by elite journalists,
politicians, and general users, we used automated event
detection to identify 1,694 news events. We find that news
on Twitter circulates faster, fades faster, and is more
negative and outraged compared to radio, with Twitter
outrage also more short-lived. We believe this is the first
large-scale comparison of outrage between Twitter and
traditional media. These patterns are consistent across
user types and robustness checks, including a breakdown by
ideology, a separate set of manually identified events, and
cross-medium event matching. We also find evidence that
some of these differences stem from differences in the
affordances of the media themselves, especially the types
of stories each selects for.

Our results illustrate an important way social media may
influence traditional media: framing and agenda-setting
simply by speaking first. As journalism evolves with these
media, news audiences may encounter faster shifts in focus,
less attention to each news event, and much more negativity
and outrage.

**CuratedDDS: A Taxonomy and a Dataset of Data-Driven Stories
to Support Journalists’ Inspiration** <a href="papers/CJ_2024_paper_54.pdf">📂</a>

*Louri Glen Kae Compain and Thomas Hurtut*

Communication, Data Driven Stories, Data Journalism, Exemples, Ideation, Inspiration, Journalism, Workflow Design

So-called Data Driven Stories (DDS) are an increasingly
popular online narrative format that combines text, media
such as photos, and data visualizations. This format
engages readers effectively due to its visual appeal and
the trustworthiness conferred by data journalism. However,
compared to more traditional formats, DDS require an
thorough ideation and design process, about its narrative
structure, and the ancitipated visualizations, which brings
up additional challenges.
In this paper, we present CurratedDDS, a tool developed to
support DDS designers by offering a curated archive of DDS
examples, annotated using a proposed DDS taxonomy, and an
exploratory interface.
To evaluate the efficiency and impact of CurratedDDS for
the target audience, we conducted an evaluation in the form
of a case study with a group of 6 media professionals.

**Google Searches Regarding Politicians are Dominated by a
Few Nonpartisan News Sources** 

*Zhen Guo, Allison Wan, Kai-Cheng Yang and David Lazer*

Google Search Engine, Source Concentration, News, Local News, Election

As the dominant platform for distributing political
information, Google Search has sparked concerns about
partisan bias, filter bubbles, and, particularly, source
concentration. Although research to date has found minimal
evidence of partisan bias or filter bubbles, this does not
necessarily absolve Google of bias, especially regarding
the distribution of sources. Previous studies have shown
that search results related to news and elections are often
limited to a small selection of domains, prompting
questions about the diversity and inclusivity of the
information provided.

This study examines to which extent Google search results
are concentrated by gathering daily data on the full names
of 604 United States governors, House representatives, and
election candidates from September 2020 to March 2021.
Searches were simulated from all 435 congressional
districts. We find the top 10 domains account for 64% of
the total one billion search results, underscoring the
significant concentration of information sources.
Furthermore, our analysis of partisan market share reveals
a mildly different distribution of domain visibility across
the party affiliation of the politician searched. Our
results also reveal persistent variations of the search
results from different locations, indicating their
significant role in customizing search results.

For the next steps, we plan to extend our investigation to
evaluate the representation of local sources within Google
Search results. We hope to reveal how well local media
outlets surfaced in searches related to political figures,
potentially illuminating the extent to which local
perspectives are accessible in the digital information
ecosystem.

**Applying AI in Newsrooms: lessons from the Applied AI in
Journalism Challenge** 

*Bahareh Heravi*

AI in Journalism, AI and News, Artificial Intelligence

This talk will explore the lessons learned from the Applied
AI Journalism Challenge (AIJC)—an accelerator program where
12 newsrooms from across the globe developed practical
generative AI applications. The program ran over five
months and was funded by the Open Society Foundation. It
served as both a prototype to accelerate the pragmatic use
of AI in newsrooms and as an innovative educational model
for integrating technological advances in the newsroom.
 
The programme involved a short training period, followed by
ongoing and sustained mentoring during a rapid and
competitive development phase. This method offered the
participating newsrooms a deep dive into generative AI
capabilities and practices, strengthened by regular
stringent deadlines and expert coaching. The practical and
mentor-driven nature of the programme's structure played a
crucial role in substantially enhancing the capabilities of
each team.

This initiative proved highly successful, notably in
fostering capable and motivated teams, and engaging them
actively as they developed significant new capabilities.
The talk will provide an overview of the programme,
highlighting the teams involved, the project, the critical
lessons learned, and potential future developments.
Furthermore, it will explore the broader impact of such
accelerator-type initiatives, emphasising their
effectiveness as a method for improving AI literacy in
newsrooms and their potential to shape the future of
journalism.

**The Challenges and Opportunities of Designing News Maps for
Mobile Devices** 

*Lily Houtman*

cartography, maps, data journalism, mobile devices, mobile technology

This abstract is for a contributed talk. As the general
public increasingly uses mobile devices in every aspect of
daily life, designing data visualizations for mobile
devices has become more important. Data journalism in
particular is a key way science and other breaking news is
communicated to the public, making attention to best
practices and studying these visuals particularly
worthwhile. Specifically, designing news maps for mobile
devices presents many challenges for data journalists due
to the fact that they use spatial data. The primary
challenges for mobile news maps fall into six key themes:
responsive and mobile-first design, screen size,
orientation, and resolution, generalization and complexity,
post-WIMP (windows, icons, mouse, pointer) environments,
technical accessibility, and individual accessibility. To
understand how data journalists work through these
challenges, I interviewed 18 news cartographers about the
present and future of mobile map design, centering
techniques and practices. While the participants offered
many creative solutions to produce beautiful and
informative data visualizations, I also identified a few
lingering challenges that warrant additional discussion and
research: types of interactivity, time constraints,
simultaneous design, and ability to conduct user testing.

**Geographic Consistency: A new framework for measuring
fluctuations and representation in local journalism** 

*Stephen Jefferson*

Local News, Spatial Data, Geography, Community Representation

This talk aims to share a new method for analyzing the
representation of local communities by measuring changes in
their news coverage over time. It will discuss how
journalists, researchers, and developers can better assess
representation by measuring local news consistency and
fluctuations within specific regions — called geographic
consistency. The speaker will define the mathematical model
for geographic consistency and share results from a case
study with three newsrooms published in 2024.

The lack of shared understanding and standardized practice
for measuring consistency in journalism has led newsrooms
to make editorial decisions that inadvertently cause
inconsistent local coverage that prevent trust-building,
such as instances of parachute journalism. The intentional
practice of geographic consistency aims to stabilize these
damaging fluctuations better and contextualize problems
that may be limiting community engagement in local news.

From a broader perspective, this talk will highlight
general lessons and advice for analyzing temporal and
spatial patterns in local journalism based on the research
team's experience and past literature review. Similarly, it
aims to illustrate how local news analysis can go beyond
short-term case studies and become a model that's
integrated into newsroom workflows to have a more
significant impact.

*Irene Larraz, Ramón Salaverría and Javier Serrano-Puche*

Fact-checking, Disinformation narratives, Artificial intelligence, Computer Sciences, Journalism, Climate disinformation

Fact-checkers are transitioning from debunking falsehoods
to analyzing disinformation narratives, aiming to uncover
common themes and underlying messages within these pieces
of misinformation. This shift seeks to piece together the
puzzle of the disinformation ecosystem, providing a
comprehensive view to better understand how false ideas
propagate and their ultimate objectives. Artificial
intelligence (AI) plays a pivotal role, facilitating the
analysis of a vast array of misinformation messages and
synthesizing key insights. This paper explores the
collaborative efforts between fact-checkers and computer
scientists through a case study focusing on the analysis of
climate misinformation narratives following farmers'
protests in Europe within the Climate Facts Europe project,
led by the EFCSN. The findings underscore the role of AI in
assisting journalists to extract primary narratives and
assess their impact over time.

**Probing GPT-4 for Knowledge of Journalistic Tasks** <a href="papers/CJ_2024_paper_17.pdf">📂</a>

*Charlotte Li and Nicholas Diakopoulos*

Journalism Work, Task Taxonomy, Agentic AI, GPT-4, Future of Work

"What is an AI system's comprehension of journalism tasks?"
This is an important question to ask as conversations
around building agents for use in newsrooms are advancing.
In order for an AI system to serve as an agent for specific
journalism tasks, it must have some understanding of the
work of journalism and how tasks within it break down. In
this paper, we assess the level of comprehension that GPT-4
has of journalism tasks using work activity and task
descriptions from O*NET. We conduct a qualitative analysis
of the output from GPT-4 and construct a journalism task
taxonomy. We find that the output from GPT-4 covers the
majority of descriptions in the baseline and offers new
insights into journalistic tasks. We propose
recommendations for future practitioner-centric research
based on our results.

**Evaluating GenAI Tools in Your Newsroom** 

*Charlotte Li, Sachita Nishal and Nicholas Diakopoulos*

Generative AI Evaluation, Benchmarking, User Studies, Generative AI in Newsrooms

Newsrooms today are adopting GenAI tools to improve the
efficiency of existing workflows on various tasks in news
production or exploring new reader experiences. However,
practitioners also express reservations around this
adoption, due to ethical concerns and technical challenges
in evaluating these tools for journalism [1]. This partly
stems from a lack of domain-specific strategies around
creating low-cost, in-house AI use-case evaluations. Our
workshop aims to empower practitioners and researchers to
undertake such evaluations: by reviewing existing
approaches to AI evaluation to lay a conceptual foundation,
and by engaging news practitioners and researchers to
brainstorm AI evaluation metrics for specific journalistic
use-cases.

To achieve this, we will first teach attendees about
existing AI evaluation approaches (e.g., benchmarking, user
studies, etc), what they offer, and where they may fall
short for journalism use-cases. We will then introduce our
framework for AI evaluation in journalism, which stresses
concrete tasks, human-AI interactions, and ethical
considerations to define success metrics [2]. Participants
will then work in breakout groups to brainstorm success
metrics and appropriate benchmark datasets to evaluate AI
for specific use-cases, such as headline generation,
summarization, etc. Afterwards, groups will share their
ideas and receive feedback, and we will document these
conversations for reference and to inform efforts to
establish an open LLM performance benchmark for news.

For these activities, we require a physical space for ~30
people for ~90 minutes with internet access, a screen, and
projector. Participants will also need to bring their own
laptops to access online resources.

**pollfinder.ai | Using Large Language Models to Help
Newsrooms Aggregate Polls For the 2024 Election** 

*Dhrumil Mehta, Aisvarya Chandrasekar and Ken Miura*

election, public opinion, polling, large language models, artificial intelligence

Pollfinder.Ai is a new project that is supported by the
2024 Brown Institute Magic Grant. The project utilizes
large language models to help newsrooms aggregate election
polls.

Newsrooms such as 538, RealClearPolitics, The Hill and The
New York Times provide valuable feeds of aggregated
pre-election polls that are used by the public and by
journalists across the industry. But as we approach the
2024 election, the process of collecting those datasets is
still painstakingly manual aside from a few automated
scrapers of polls that publish consistently in a
predictable location and format. Research assistants spend
hours identifying new polls and entering them into a
polling database. But LLMs can extract structured data out
of unstructured formats.

The Columbia University-based team – including a former 538
staff member – is building a tool to automate portions of
this data collection using LLMs. The system we are building
uses multimodal LLMs to (1) sift through noisy keyword
searches of content from places like X (formerly Twitter)
and Google News Alerts to separate releases of polls from
articles that reference them (2) extract metadata such as
the start and end date of the survey, the name of the
pollster, who sponsored the poll, etc from the press
releases or poll pdfs and (3) index questions in the polls
to include more aggregated issue polling. In this session
we will show our system architecture, edit processes, and
our preliminary findings on how well LLMs perform at this
task.

demonstration of ways to use LLM chatbots like ChatGPT to
build charts, graphs, tables and other kinds of data
visualizations including interactive graphics in D3.js. The
session leaders will demonstrate a few ways that they have
used ChatGPT to help build production graphics, and then
attendees will build their own! No previous JavaScript
experience is necessary, although having some coding
experience will be helpful.

At the end of the workshop, we'll have a short demo where
everyone can share what they have built. We will also
collect the charts that everyone makes alongside the
initial prompts they used and a transcript of their
conversation, which we will put together as an artifact
that attendees can reference after the session.

Previous Iterations: This workshop is an iteration of a
successful workshop that we presented at NICAR 2024. The
materials for that workshop can be found at

The Data Journalism Teachers’ Club is a new community of
educators — professors, teachers, trainers, and everyone in
between — who are interested in thinking about frameworks
for effective and thoughtful ways to teach data skills to
journalists by putting the profession and practice of data
journalism in conversation with pedagogy and learning
experts and scholars of teaching.

In this talk, we will briefly describe the aims of the new
organization, make the case for integration of more formal
pedagogical design practices in journalism education, and
walk through some of what we have learned through the past
year of conversations with pedagogy experts and texts,
including our three-part course design workshop series over
the summer.

Our goal is to support new, seasoned and interested data
journalism teachers by creating a space for structured and
informed conversations about the science of teaching and
learning for our field.

identify and define jargon terms in scientific abstracts,
based on readers' self-reported knowledge. The system
achieves fairly high recall in identifying jargon and
preserves relative differences in readers' jargon
identification, suggesting personalization as a feasible
use-case for LLMs to support sense-making of complex
information. Surprisingly, using only abstracts for context
to generate definitions yields slightly more accurate and
higher quality definitions than using RAG-based context
from the fulltext of an article. The findings highlight the
potential of generative AI for assisting science reporters,
and inform future work on developing tools to simplify

The rapidly changing landscape of journalism has seen a
growing concern over news deserts – regions where local
news coverage is sparse or non-existent. We also stand on
the precipice of a new era of computational research in the
world of journalism, and this study proposes a new
approach: leveraging Supervised Machine Learning (SML) to
predict the emergence of these news deserts. Drawing from
different comprehensive datasets this project attempts to
build predictive models, assessing a mix of social,

risk of becoming a news desert. At an intersection of
traditional journalism research and modern computational
methods, we employ Logistic Regression and Random Forests
algorithms to further our understanding of the growing
challenge of news deserts.

**Modeling Information Change in Science Communication with
Natural Language Processing** 

*Jiaxin Pei*

Science Communication, NLP, Computational Journalism

Public trust in science is dependent, in part, on
journalists accurately reporting the latest scientific
advances. The process of reporting on science requires
careful effort to faithfully translate academic jargon into
descriptions more accessible to the general public. In this
talk, I will majorly describe two of my works on
quantifying the information change in science
communication. In the first part, I focus on how certain
journalists describe scientific findings compared with the
scholars. By building new computational models and
analyzing a large-scale science communication dataset, I
show how both scholars and journalists vary in how and when
findings are described with certainty.  In the second part,
I will focus on the more general task of measuring whether
the information of a finding changes in journalistic
descriptions. I will introduce a new resource and model for
aligning scientific findings from news stories, social
media discussions, and full texts of academic papers. I
will show how this new resource can improve downstream
performance on evidence retrieval for fact-checking of
real-world scientific claims and, through applying the
model to millions of science news reports, can reveal
large-scale trends in the degrees to which people and
organizations faithfully communicate new scientific
findings. At the end of the talk, I will discuss my ongoing
efforts in building human-centered language technologies
for effective science communication.

Social network analysis, Data analytics, Data journalism

During his Nieman Fellowship year, Julian, a sport
journalist, studied with Hong, a computational social
scientist, to apply network science theory and methods to
analyze the factors that lead to successful collaborations
in lawmaking and in sports.  This workshop empowers
investigative and sports journalists to add network
analysis skills in their repertoire.  First, we introduce
scientifically rigorous approaches to model social
interactions and processes as graph data.  Then, we deep
dive into two cases studies utilizing real world datasets
from Congress.gov and NBA Stats: Hong will teach how to
build a step-by-step data pipeline for acquiring bill
co-sponsorship data and transforming them into a bipartite
network of congress member nodes and bill nodes with edges
representing congress members who cosponsor the same bill;
Julian will present a network analysis of basketball ball
passing network.  We demonstrate how to code using Python's
NetworkX library to calculate network statistics and derive
insights about key players (centrality), motifs (recurring
clusters or flows), and factors driving success, which can
be defined as passing bills into laws, scoring points, or
winning games.  For visualization, we will use Flourish
Studio's interactive chart templates: Chord, Sankey, and
Network.  This hands-on workshop inspires and trains data
journalists to brainstorm, incorporate, and implement
social network analysis in their newsgathering and visual
presentation.

**Revealing the localness of news domains through consumption
patterns on social media** 

*Alexi Quintana, Kai-Cheng Yang, Pranav Geol, Burak Ozturan
and David Lazer*

local news, audience, social media, computational method

Local news is an integral pillar of the US democratic
process, uniquely positioned to report on local affairs and
elections. Recent studies have spotlighted topics like the
digital consumption of local news and the decline of local
news agencies, often referred to as the news desert
phenomenon. A key piece of quantifying the changing local
media landscape is classifying news outlets as local or
national. Traditional classification methods, however,
often rely on self-designations and human judgment,
potentially misrepresenting actual consumption patterns and
overlooking nuanced distribution differences.

This study introduces a data-driven metric to measure the
localness of news domains using a Twitter dataset where
over one million accounts are geo-located by matching their
profiles with voter registration data. We employ these
users' overall sharing frequency of various news domains as
a surrogate for measuring statewide news consumption. We
then quantify the disparity between the observed
distribution of a news domain and its expected distribution
across states. We hypothesize that national news domains
will exhibit minimal state-specific deviations while local
outlets will show pronounced deviations in particular
states.

Preliminary results suggest that our metric aligns well
with classifications from prior research, confirming our
hypothesis. Importantly, our metric unveils nuanced
localization patterns by providing a continuous measure of
an outlet's localness and pinpointing the specific states
where each local domain is over-represented. We plan to
publicly release our metric and the localness scores for
various domains, facilitating its use in broader research
contexts.

conceptualize content deserts: geographic areas that are
systematically undercovered or not covered at all by the
local press. We demonstrate an early approach to leveraging
open-source large language models to identify article
locations as well as key information about articles such as
topic and community information need. We show that
open-source language models can accurately identify the
locations mentioned in a news article. When it comes to
annotating local news articles, we show that the models
perform well for tagging an article's topic, but that other
local categorizations do not perform as well. We deploy the
best-performing model and prompt on a set of 1,000 articles
from two publication, and demonstrate how the annotations
can help to identify content deserts. Looking forward,
these methods will allow for the construction of auditing
tools for journalists to view how their coverage differs by
neighborhood along topical axes.

**Workshop: Preparing for the day after: Covering elections
through the inauguration** 

*Jason Radford*

Elections, Scenarios, Collaboration

Elections do not end on election night. From counts and
recounts, procedural lawsuits, certification, and
inauguration; traditionally pro forma election processes
have become critical points of contention. Journalists and
news organizations must cover these critical events filled
with nuanced election rules and esoteric legal issues.

In this workshop, we run participants through a series of
post-election scenarios. Participants will discuss how they
and their newsrooms might approach covering these scenarios
and share ideas for covering issues.

The goal of this workshop is for participants to think
through potential scenarios and share resources and ideas
for covering election-related stories after election night.
Participants will also walk away with a better
understanding of how other newsrooms may cover these events.

**Perceptions and Corrections of Misleading News Headlines:
Insights from Journalists and News Consumers** <a href="papers/CJ_2024_paper_33.pdf">📂</a>

*Md Main Uddin Rony, Saransh Grover, Farhana Uddin, Yoo Yeon
Sung, Mohammad Ali and Naeemul Hassan*

Misleading Headline, Misinformation, Disinformation, Online News Consumption

The Internet's vast information landscape allows for
widespread consumption and publication of content, but not
all information is of high quality. Misleading news
headlines, where headlines do not accurately reflect their
articles, pose significant risks by confusing audiences.
Despite their impact on information ecosystems, they have
received relatively little attention compared to other
misinformation forms like fake news, rumors, and hoaxes.
This study aims to address this gap by exploring the
perceptions of journalists (news producers) and online news
consumers. Our research investigates how journalists and
news consumers define and react to misleading headlines and
the types of corrections they provide when headlines are
deemed misleading. By comparing these perspectives, we
uncover common techniques and discrepancies in the
identification and correction of misleading headlines. The
insights gained inform the development of effective
strategies to combat this type of misinformation, enhancing
our understanding of the unique challenges posed by
misleading news headlines and promoting a healthier
information ecosystem.

**Bias or Not? Exploring US Press Representations of Law
Enforcement in Lynching Coverage, 1789–1963** <a href="papers/CJ_2024_paper_18.pdf">📂</a>

*Mohamed Salama*

Media Bias, Law Enforcement, Lynching, Natural Language Processing, Historical Analysis

This research is inspired by existing scholarly literature
[1,3,4,5,8,9,10], which argues for the explicit or implicit
involvement of the press and law enforcement in the
historical practices of lynching in the US. These arguments
are typically based on piecemeal evidence and isolated
reports, which may lack comprehensiveness. Leveraging
access to 60,000 newspapers spanning from 1789 to 1963,
this study rigorously investigates the norm of objectivity
by analyzing 1,767 stories specifically mentioning law
enforcement to understand how the press portrayed these
authorities. Given that the concept of journalistic
objectivity was novel during this era, we will scrutinize
tonality bias—defined as the positive or negative slant in
reporting—based on the framework by Eberl et al [2]. Our
methodology employs a carefully designed model that
integrates dependency parsing and sentiment analysis
techniques. This approach allows for precise detection of
objectivity and bias in journalistic reporting, adding a
new layer to the investigation that enhances the depth of
analysis and offers insights for future research.

**An Annotated Dataset of U.S. Transgender News For
Determining Agenda-Setting & Information Flows** 

*Alyssa Smith, Sagar Kumar, Yukun Yang and Pranav Goel*

agenda-setting, annotated dataset, information flows, trans studies

Mainstream news outlets set the agenda and terms of
discussion for public discourse across various issues. As
transgender people experience increasingly vitriolic
attacks on their fundamental rights in the U.S.,
understanding the structure and dynamics of media
discussions of transgender people becomes even more
salient. We have collected a dataset of news articles about
transgender people and trans issues from U.S. local and
national media; our analyses using transfer entropy, a
measure of information flow, indicate that while national
media generally exert influence on local outlets in
transgender discourses, the structure of such influence is
often more complex than a simple one-step flow from
national to local outlets. Our current approach employs
Latent Dirichlet Allocation, an unsupervised method, to
identify the major topics in transgender discourses. To
better understand how more subtle aspects of coverage
spread, we plan to incorporate human judgment into our
workflow.
We propose a dataset annotation pipeline for crowdsourced
multi-label classification and taxonomy creation. It
involves Amazon Mechanical Turk crowdworkers independently
defining the topic space and assigning topic labels for
articles using the DELUGE method (Bragg, 2013). DELUGE
allows for probabilistic worker accuracy and asks questions
of crowdworkers such that maximal information is gained
from each question answered. The resulting annotated
dataset will be invaluable to our research as well as to
future studies in transgender discourses. It will be free
from the biases domain experts might introduce, while still
maintaining the richness and requisite world-knowledge that
can come only from human annotations.

**Physical data visualization workshop** 

*Andres Snitcofsky*

dataviz, physical, space intervention, performative

In this engaging and hands-on workshop, journalists will
explore the art of storytelling with data visuaization
through innovative and tangible means. Participants will be
organized into teams and tasked with selecting open
datasets, which they will then bring to life using a
variety of physical materials such as tape, strings,
balloons, and cardboard boxes, many of which are reused or
leftover items. This creative approach encourages
journalists to think beyond traditional screen-based
visualizations and to craft compelling narratives that can
be experienced in physical space.

Throughout the workshop, I will guide participants through
each stage of the process, from dataset selection and
conceptualization to the construction and presentation of
their data stories. This collaborative environment fosters
connections among participants and sparks meaningful
discussions about the power and potential of data
storytelling in various media.

The workshop will culminate in a final "show and tell"
session, where teams will present their physical
visualizations to the group, sharing insights and
reflections on their creative processes and the stories
they have uncovered. This final showcase not only
highlights the diverse ways data can be visualized but also
emphasizes the importance of innovation and collaboration
in journalism.

Join us for a unique opportunity to enhance your data
storytelling skills, connect with fellow journalists, and
discover new perspectives on visualizing information in
compelling and accessible ways

**Strategies for Success: Dos and Don'ts in the Digital
Transformation of Media Companies** 

*Catherine Sotirakou, Katerina Mandenaki, Anastasia
Karampela and Constantinos Mourlas*

Artificial Intelligence, Data Journalism, Digital Transformation, Media Industries

In an era defined by digitization the media industry
struggles to avoid “Digital Darwinism”. Our work
investigates the current state of digital transformation in
four European countries and focuses on digital literacy,
artificial intelligence, monetization strategies and
organizational adaptation. We conducted a quantitative
survey administered to 150 professionals from circa 90
media organizations across Greece, France, Portugal and
Cyprus. The results depict a digital transformation in the
media industry that is yet to fully embrace the potential
of AI and data analytics. Publishers’ hesitation reflects
broader concerns about technology's influence on
journalism, although there is widespread interest in
exploring how AI can be utilized to enhance the quality of
news and boost revenue. The study further delves into
digital literacy and highlights the necessity for targeted
training in certain areas, since most of the participants
are not aware of existing AI tools for journalism and
marketing. Furthermore, managers in the media sector seem
to ignore the potential for new business models to
reconfigure existing profit-making structures and remain
focused on advertisements and sponsored content as their
principal revenue sources.

This work is done in the context of IQ Media Hub, that
based on this knowledge, designed a forward-looking
curriculum that spans from basic digital literacy to
advanced technological applications, aiming to bridge the
gap and prepare media organizations for the digital future.

The above study is Co-funded by the European Union under
the program “IQ Media: A Collaborative Framework Towards
Business Transformation, Innovation, Quality Journalism,
and Advanced Digital Skills in the Media Environment

**Surfacing Newsworthy Public Documents As Leads** <a href="papers/CJ_2024_paper_45.pdf">📂</a>

*Alexander Spangher, Emilio Ferrara, Ben Welsh, Nanyun Peng,
Serdar Tumgoren and Jonathan May*

Newsworthiness prediction, Document Linking, Computational Journalism

"Newsworthiness prediction" means trying to assess whether
a particular story lead will get covered or not. In this
work, we build newsworthiness predictors to find stories in
voluminous city council meetings, aiming to reduce the time
and effort it takes journalists to find stories. Building
training datasets for this task is challenging: it is hard,
ex post facto, to prove that a certain policy has or has
not covered. We address this problem by implementing a
novel probabilistic relational modeling framework, which we
show is a low-annotation methodology that outperforms
other, more state-of-the-art retrieval-based baselines. We
scale this linking methodology across 13k city council
policies from San Francisco Board of Supervisor meetings
and 200k articles from the San Francisco Chronicle over 10
years of public policy meetings, finding about 7\% of
policies get covered. Finally, we used this linked dataset
to fine-tune language models to consume policy text,
transcribed video, public discussion, and other features,
and predict the likelihood of coverage. We perform human
evaluation with expert journalists and show our systems
identify newsworthy policies with 68\% F1-score and our
coverage recommendations are helpful with an 84\% win-rate
against baseline.

**Missing in Detroit: Creating a framework for equitable
reporting and minimizing harm** <a href="papers/CJ_2024_paper_47.pdf">📂</a>

*Kristi Tanner, Anjanette Delgado and Stephen Harding*

missing persons, automation, AI

Slightly more than one person per day is reported missing
in Detroit. Journalists are inundated with more emails and
social media posts than they can manage from law
enforcement looking for assistance from the public to solve
missing person cases. Historically, socioeconomic factors
such as race, gender, education, age and income have
unfairly elevated coverage of some over others.
This talk will explain the automation process we created to
cover every missing person reported in Detroit and keep
track of when people are found – a machine learning and NLG
workflow with journalists in the loop. We will review
research and decisions made prior to publication to reduce
harm and increase the opportunity for impact.
We’re excited to show the careful considerations that
newsrooms have to make when working with AI and sensitive
subjects.
For example, after further research and a conversation with
Karen Shalev, professor of missing person studies at the
University of Portsmouth, England, we chose to reference
the first name only of missing children. Dropping the last
name of missing youths aims to reduce the digital footprint
for children who are later recovered where the “right to be
forgotten” does not currently exist.
Another edit, a change in frequency and format, except in
the case of serious missing alerts, was made after reading
the work of Lampinen & Moore (2016) who discuss public
fatigue and the “car alarm effect.”
Finally, we will continue conversations with law
enforcement and researchers on increasing media coverage of
missing persons without increasing vulnerabilities. The
Missing in Detroit project launches in June.

**Syntaktis: A Large-Language-Model-Backed Editing Interface
for Supporting Ethical Journalism Practices** <a href="papers/CJ_2024_paper_23.pdf">📂</a>

*Leah Teichholtz, Katy Gero and Elena Glassman*

human-AI interaction, large language models, ethical journalism, editing, computational journalism

We present Syntaktis, a novel interactive computational
journalism tool backed by a large language model that
automates the identification of several key ethical
journalism problems. The interface aims to augment human
journalists, not replace them, by offering optional
feedback and revisions like an experienced editor. To do
so, Syntaktis is trained on the ethical journalism
principles of the Society for Professional Journalists,
which represent a gold standard taught in journalism
schools and used by newspapers nationwide. We evaluate the
efficacy of the interface through a user study with 14
student journalists and the quality of its output with a
technical evaluation performed by two professional editors.

**Using Generative Agents to Create Tip Sheets for
Investigative Data Reporting** <a href="papers/CJ_2024_paper_15.pdf">📂</a>

*Joris Veerbeek and Nicholas Diakopoulos*

generative agents, computational news discovery, artificial intelligence, investigative data reporting, computational journalism

This paper introduces a system using generative AI agents
to create tip sheets for investigative data reporting. Our
system employs three specialized agents—analyst, reporter,
and editor—to collaboratively generate and refine tips from
datasets. We validate this approach using real-world
investigative stories, demonstrating that our agent-based
system generally generates more newsworthy and accurate
insights compared to a baseline model without agents,
although some variability was noted between different
stories. Our findings highlight the potential of generative
AI to provide leads for investigative data reporting.

good? Behind the scenes of producing the Atlas of
Sustainable Development Goals 2023** 

*Divyanshi Wadhwa and Alice Thudt*

global development, data visualization, data storytelling, global public goods

The Atlas of Sustainable Development Goals 2023
(https://datatopics.worldbank.org/sdgatlas/) presents
interactive storytelling and data visualizations about the
17 Sustainable Development Goals. It highlights trends for
selected targets within each goal and describes how some
SDGs are measured. In this talk, we will showcase some data
stories and visualizations from the Atlas that won the top
“Most Beautiful” award at last year’s “Information is
Beautiful Awards” and explain how we approach digital
storytelling and data visualization at the World Bank with
a view to creating a data public good.
The session’s objectives include:
1. Offering strategies for and discussing challenges around:
a) achieving the right balance between complexity,
accuracy, and effectiveness in telling data stories (about
global development);
b) identifying meaningful and compelling stories from large
data sets; and
c) developing creative and powerful data visuals that not
only inform and educate, but also engage audiences.
2. Discussing the benefits and challenges of producing the
Atlas in cross-functional collaboration among data
scientists, economists, writers, and data visualization
developers.
3. Describing our approach to making a data visualization
publication a public good through data transparency and an
open data and open code approach.

**What We've Learned: Teaming up journalism and computer
science students to produce data-driven investigations for
news outlets** 

*Brooke Williams*

data-driven, computational, journalism, news partners, collaborations, student newsrooms

We launched the Justice Media Computational Journalism
co-Lab in January 2021, and in the years since students in
the co-Lab have published about 20 data-driven
investigative news stories with nine news organizations. In
other words, we have learned a lot about creating a
student-driven newsroom, finding partners, working with
editors and reporters, and what we can do, or not do, to
help ensure the collaborations are succesful and the
projects precise and impactful.

We see the co-Lab as one part of a solution to the lack of
resources in newsrooms needed to consistently produce this
type of vital yet time consuming journalism.

Justice Media co-Lab students — both journalism and
computer science — have published an investigation on the
front page of the Boston Globe based on a database they
built of grievances from people in prison.
Interdisciplinary student teams — as a part of the Justice
Media course offered in spring or fall or via a summer
internship — dug deep into data to publish a project on the
racism behind today's inequitable impacts of extreme heat
for the Emancipator. They've shed light on allegations of
prison guards abusing their power GBH, examined political
rhetoric leading up to the mid term elections for USA Today
and used computational methods to uncover a persistent
gender pay gap at the University of Massachusetts for NBC
Boston, among many other projects and partners. We are
launching a Justice Media co-Lab fellowship this year.

We currently have two summer interns and are on the runway
to publish a nationwide examination with ProPublica and
another for a national investigative nonprofit — slated to
be published in the coming months.

We could include faculty, students and others in this talk.

**Public Concerns Over AI-Supercharging Misinformation in the
2024 US Presidential Election** 

*Harry Yaojun Yan, Garrett Morrow, Kai-Cheng Yang and John
Wihbey*

generative AI, misinformation, election, news consumption, survey

Researchers and the media have highlighted the potential
adverse effects of artificial intelligence (AI) on the 2024
US Presidential election. However, it remains unclear how
concerned the public is about AI's role in spreading
misinformation and which information sources contribute to
these concerns.

To address this gap, this study surveyed 1,001 Americans
and found that four out of five (83.32%) were worried about
AI being used to spread misinformation in the upcoming
election. This high prevalence of concern was consistent
across various demographic groups. News consumption,
particularly television news, contributes to the high
prevalence of concerns. In contrast, knowledge of ChaGPT
development and direct experience with generative AI tools,
such as ChatGPT and DALL-E, do little to alleviate the
concerns.

The high prevalence of concerns about AI spreading
misinformation in the upcoming elections is likely due to a
combination of worries about election integrity in general,
fear of the disruptive potential of AI technology, and its
sensationalized news coverage. Although it remains
uncertain whether these concerns are warranted, our
findings highlight the need for AI literacy campaigns that
focus on building knowledge rather than fostering fear in
the public.

news consumption, information consumption, data donation, social media, browsing data, mobile data

The National Internet Observatory (NIO) aims to help
researchers study online behavior. Participants install a
browser extension and/or mobile apps to donate their online
activity data along with comprehensive survey responses.
The infrastructure will offer approved researchers access
to a suite of structured, parsed content data for selected
social media and news outlets. This data will help
journalists and researchers understand participants' news
and information consumption on social media and the various
pathways taken to reach particular news websites and
articles on the Internet. The whole process is conducted
within a robust research ethics framework, emphasizing
ongoing informed consent and multiple layers, technical and
legal, of interventions to protect the values at stake in
data collection, data access, and research.

The proposed workshop will provide a brief overview of the
NIO infrastructure, the data collected, the participants,
and the researcher intake process. Participants are
expected to learn about NIO, build connections, and
potentially initiate collaborations through the workshop.

At the time of this submission, the workshop had not been
presented at other conferences, but we are planning to
deliver it at a couple of different venues in the coming
months.

We would need a projector for the presentation and
demonstration.

**Finding and using undocumented APIs** 

*Leon Yin and Piotr Sapiezynski*

Web scraping, Data collection, API, Case studies, YouTube, Google, Amazon, Internet service provider

This workshop will introduce reporters and researchers to
an exciting and overlooked data
source found on most websites: undocumented APIs.

As opposed to documented and official APIs, undocumented
APIs are unofficial and hidden in
plain sight. They execute essential functions behind the
scenes, many of them are so mundane
that most people don’t even realize that something is
happening.

Undocumented APIs are a key tool for investigations as a
public data source when access is
otherwise unreachable.

Speakers will introduce the topic, and go through case
studies: investigations into Amazon
private label products, Google’s keyword blocklist for
YouTube advertisers, and mapping the
digital divide in the United States using millions of
Internet service plans. Speakers will discuss
the thought process and trials involved with each case
study, imparting tips and best practices
along the way.

Importantly, participants will learn how to find and use
undocumented APIs through a hands-on
exercise and will be encouraged to find APIs in the wild
during independent practice.

This workshop was presented at NICAR, FAccT, and C+J and
has been gradually improved based on the feedback from the
previous sessions.

The contents of the workshop can be found at
inspectelement.org/apis.html. The participants can use
their own computers, so only a projector screen and
internet connection is necessary to run this workshop.

The workshop will be led by Leon Yin, an investigative
journalist at Bloomberg News, and Piotr
Sapiezynski, an algorithm audit researcher at Northeastern
University.

**Labeling AI-Generated News Content: Matching Journalist
Intentions with Audience Expectations** <a href="papers/CJ_2024_paper_14.pdf">📂</a>

*Jessica Zier and Nicholas Diakopoulos*

Generative AI, Transparency, Disclosure, Labeling

Improvements in generative AI functionality and
accessibility offer journalists a powerful tool to assist
with content production, workflows, and efficiency. This
increase in generative AI for news production calls for
journalists to increase transparency around how they use
this technology. Recent policy developments, such as the AI
Act, Art 50., are further instigating the necessity of AI
transparency. Disclosure, in the form of labeling, of
AI-generated content is one such transparency strategy that
is becoming increasingly common in news media. However,
this disclosure is meaningless if readers are unsure of how
to interpret the labels. This approach could backfire if
there is a mismatch between the well-intentioned goal of
labeling for transparency and reader interpretations of
what these labels signal. Since there is no uniformity and
guidelines are piecemeal on how exactly to implement
labeling, this paper offers a starting point for bridging
the knowledge gap between AI transparency as a principle
and AI transparency as a practice to better align
journalists’ transparency goals with reader expectations
around AI-use disclosure.
